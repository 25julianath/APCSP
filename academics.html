	<p>This school year was a step up from my freshman year. The classes, such as chemistry and history, were very challening but very rewarding. An upside of the school year was finishing with all A's last semester. My english teacher drives a motercycle around town which is why there is a motor cylce on the collage. My favorite class this year was English.</p>
